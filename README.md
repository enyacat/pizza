# 8 bit pizza - a React Pizza shop

in progress...of adding redux, add authenticaton (auth0) and stripe payment to make a fully functioning pizza shop.

but deployed at https://8-bit-pizza.netlify.app/ for show.

- The initial version before https://github.com/enyacat/8bitpizza and deployed here https://eight-bit-pizza.herokuapp.com/. My intention was to remake a pizza shop website http://pizza2go.net.au/

## Available Scripts

The original pizza website is my wireframe. The goal is to integrate as much of the ordering functions as possible: display menu, add pizza, select/deselect toppings, select sizes and etc.
