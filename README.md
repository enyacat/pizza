# 8 bit pizza - a React Pizza shop

My **ongoing** pizza shop project - aim to make a fully functional pizza shop (remake from Pizza2go's website: http://pizza2go.net.au/)

Continuously deployed at https://8-bit-pizza.netlify.app/.

#### Latest updates:

Authenticaton (auth0) and stripe payment

#### In progress:

Working on redux

#### Yet to be done:

- Editing page not able to retain some of the previous info.
- In 'deals' option, need to be able to add specific items.
- CSS

P.S.

- The initial version before https://github.com/enyacat/8bitpizza and deployed here https://eight-bit-pizza.herokuapp.com/ but got bugs.

## Some thoughts

It is not easy to manage all the food and drinks. e.g. pizzas with different default toppings.
